			<p>King's street is part of a network of coffee shops around Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Long Island city. 
			Together, our shops are committed to making quality coffee, sourcing ethically, paying employees an excellent wage, and uplifting
			other small businesses in our local community. Our shops often host cross-shop pop-ups and events for good local causes and share best practices
			regarding sustainability, inclusion, and all-things coffee.
			We believe the saying that if you want to go fast, go alone, if you want to go far, go together. 
			Each shop on this list has a different vibe, a different menu, and a beautiful approach to coffee and community. 
			When you get a chance, explore the coffee offerings and the surrounding neighborhoods of these amazing sister spots. 
			Just remember to come back!
